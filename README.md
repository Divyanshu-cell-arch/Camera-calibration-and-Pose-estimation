# Camera-calibration-and-Pose-estimation

This project involved calibrating a camera using computer vision techniques with 211 images that was taken by a camera. By employing the OpenCV library to detect key points and compute intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, lens distortion was minimized, and 3D measurement accuracy was enhanced. The calibrated camera now provides improved precision. With the help of calibrated camera's Camera matrix and Distortion coefficient we estimated the pose of the chessboard with respect to the camera.
